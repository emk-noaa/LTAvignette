# Appendix: Backlog {#backlog}

- Fix polygon area estimation! (Currently does not subtract land area! Ack!)  

- Handle probable species in `process_sightings()`. Probable species currently are not handled in `process_sightings()`: I need a dataset that has a probable event in order to code. Look for it in the CCS data.  

- Main Islands map bbox  

- Map bbox for SoCal, Central Cal, and northern CCS  

- Figure out which ETP strata to have as defaults for both survey strata and study area polygons (there are like 100 in the folder Jeff sent us).  May be a question for Tim G.  

- Test this code on lots of cruise data files to establish basic functionality for Hawaii, California Current, and ETP.   
- Troubleshoot why longitudes are not displayed on Hawaii base map

- Accommodate subgroup settings for FKW analyses

- Close comparison to FORTRAN outputs  

- Onward into next stages of Data Processing milestones 

- Method for stratifying by Beaufort.  

- `study_area_explore()` and `study_area_select()`.
