# Appendix: Backlog {#backlog}

- Appendix for helper functions, incl `species_translator()`.  

- Method for stratifying by Beaufort.  

- Add setting to specify which species to pass on to Distance  

- Handle probable species in `process_sightings`   

- Add Survey summary function / section to this Rmd  

- Add feature that calculates polygon area if not provided in stratum filename.  

- `study_area_explore()` and `study_area_select()`.  

- Figure out which ETP strata to have as defaults for both survey strata and study area polygons (there are like 100 in the folder Jeff sent us).  May be a question for Tim G.  

- Test this code on lots of cruise data files to establish basic functionality for Hawaii, California Current, and ETP.   

- Build up settings file functionality for processing sightings (formatting DAT files for group size coefficients, etc.)  

- Plotting functions for species (or subsets of species)  

- Troubleshoot why longitudes are not displayed on Hawaii base map

- Accommodate subgroup settings for FKW analyses

- Close comparison to FORTRAN outputs  

- Onward into next stages of Data Processing milestones
