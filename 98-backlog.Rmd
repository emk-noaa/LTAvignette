# Appendix: Backlog {#backlog}

- Investigate discrepancies between output from `format_distance()` and `summarize_effort()`.  

- Follow-through on converting `format_distance()` to match the formatting from `ABUND9`? (It is currently matching the format from `ABUND7`).  

- Fix polygon area estimation! (Currently does not subtract land area! Ack!)  

- Consider making the minimum group size for group size calibration (for unknown observers) a cohort-specific setting that users can define.  Update all package and vignette documentation accordingly. 

- Consider making the km gap handling arguments for `format_das()` (and its subroutine `process_km()`) into survey settings that users can define. Update all package and vignette documentation accordingly. 

- Jay uses the phrase 'stratify by IO': add segmentizing feature in which segment is reset if IO status changes. 

- Main Islands map bbox  

- Map bbox for SoCal, Central Cal, and northern CCS  

- Figure out which ETP strata to have as defaults for both survey strata and study area polygons (there are like 100 in the folder Jeff sent us).  May be a question for Tim G.  

- Test this code on lots of cruise data files to establish basic functionality for Hawaii, California Current, and ETP.   

- Troubleshoot why longitudes are not displayed on Hawaii base map

- Accommodate subgroup settings for FKW analyses

- Method for stratifying by Beaufort.  

- `study_area_explore()` and `study_area_select()`.
