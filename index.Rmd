# Status

This status report outlines the code we are developing to process `WinCruz` data and prepare it for density estimation analysis using `distance` and related packages in `R`.  

#### Changes {-}

- New **status report format** (a `bookdown` vignette, compatible with a future website and PDF tutorial.)  

- **Initiation of package framework** (more efficient to design, develop, test, and document code). See `Install` chapter for details. 

- Implementation of **new settings system**: survey-wide and cohort-specific settings. See `Settings` chapter for description / explanation.  

- Update of strata and segmentizing functions to accommodate new settings system.  See `Processing` chapter.  

- The function `process_polygon()` now calculates the area, in km2, of strata and study area polygons.   


#### Next focus {-}

- Transfer code to the new settings system and package framework:  

--- mapping functions  
--- sightings processing  
--- survey summary   

- Update backlog  

- Back to developing the sightings processing  


#### Questions for Amanda {-}

- Lots of structural changes (new vignette system, initiation of package framework). Lots on my list to do to complete the transfer, so not many questions for now.  

- Am I getting closer with the new settings / segmentizing frameworks?
