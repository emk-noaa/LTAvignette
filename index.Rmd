# Status

This status report outlines the code we are developing to process `WinCruz` data and prepare it for density estimation analysis using `distance` and related packages in `R`.  

#### Recent changes {-}

- New `format_distance()` function creates tables that match `EFFORT.csv` and `SIGHTINGS.csv`.  

- Skeletonized new summary functions (see the [Summarize page](#summarize)).      

- Ship name is now added to all dataframes.  

- New `process_sightings()` function, with code for calibrating group sizes according to user-provided coefficient tables (mirroring `ABUND9` with slight mods, e.g., school size threshold for observers not in the `Coeff.DAT` file.). (Details: the function `process_sightings()` relies upon a utility function, `group_size()`, which in turn relies upon `group_size_calibrate()`.)

- Added cohort-specific setting, `school_size_calibrate`, that allows researchers to specify whether a cohort should or should not have school sizes calibrated. Example use case: `school_size_calibrate = TRUE` for a cohort of dolphin species, but make it `FALSE` for a cohort of large baleen whales.  

- Basic function for mapping sightings (QA/QC): `map_sightings()`.  

- Added detail/polish to vignette pages on [Settings](#settings), [Processing Data](#processing), and the [Appendix on Segmentizing](#segmentizing). I believe these are ready for close review.    

- Added detailed comments to code for all functions to date.  


#### Next focus {-}

- Review INP files shared by Amanda 

- EFFORT and SIGHTINGS outputs / stage for distance

- Survey summary   

- Efficient system for testing on various datasets 

- Document function manuals   

 

#### Questions for Amanda {-}

- FKW handling

- What is the ship list used for?
