[["processing.html", " 4 Data processing Behind the scenes Review", " 4 Data processing You can process your survey data using a single function, process_surveys(), which takes two arguments: the filepath(s) to your DAS survey data, and your settings object. For example: process_surveys(das_file = &#39;data/surveys/HICEASwinter2020.das&#39;, settings = settings) That single command will convert your raw DAS data to a “cruz” object, a list of polished datasets that are prepared to be passed to subsequent analyses. That function is a wrapper for several discrete stages of data formatting/processing. Behind the scenes, each of those stages is carried out using a specific LTabundR function. The remainder of this page is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the data processing that occurs when you call process_surveys(). Behind the scenes Bring in cruise data Specify the path to your .DAS data file(s): das_file &lt;- &#39;data/surveys/HICEASwinter2020.das&#39; Read in and process this .DAS file using the functions in Sam’s swfscDAS package. To do so quickly, we built a wrapper function that makes this quick and easy: das &lt;- load_das(das_file, perform_checks = TRUE, print_glimpse = TRUE) ## Reading DAS file ## Processing DAS file ## Checking DAS file ## Cruise numbers: ## 2001 &lt;NA&gt; ## 48 0 ## Rows: 22,486 ## Columns: 40 ## $ Event &lt;chr&gt; &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, … ## $ DateTime &lt;dttm&gt; 2020-01-19 07:11:52, 2020-01-19 07:13:52, 2020-01-19 07:15:… ## $ Lat &lt;dbl&gt; 21.79983, 21.80517, 21.81050, 21.81583, 21.82133, 21.82667, … ## $ Lon &lt;dbl&gt; -159.7652, -159.7657, -159.7662, -159.7668, -159.7673, -159.… ## $ OnEffort &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALS… ## $ Cruise &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 2001, 2001, 2001, 20… ## $ Mode &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, … ## $ OffsetGMT &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, -10, -10, -10, -10, … ## $ EffType &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;… ## $ ESWsides &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2… ## $ Course &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 350,… ## $ SpdKt &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 9.9,… ## $ Bft &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 4, 4, 4,… ## $ SwellHght &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 6, 6, 6,… ## $ WindSpdKt &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 15, 15, … ## $ RainFog &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ HorizSun &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ VertSun &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Glare &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Vis &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ ObsL &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;126&quot;, &quot;126&quot;… ## $ Rec &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;307&quot;, &quot;307&quot;… ## $ ObsR &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;238&quot;, &quot;238&quot;… ## $ ObsInd &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data1 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;126&quot;, … ## $ Data2 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;C&quot;, NA, &quot;307&quot;, &quot;06&quot;… ## $ Data3 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;-10&quot;, NA, &quot;238&quot;, &quot;1… ## $ Data4 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;N&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA,… ## $ Data5 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;15.0&quot;, … ## $ Data6 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data7 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data8 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data9 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data10 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data11 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ Data12 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ EffortDot &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALS… ## $ EventNum &lt;chr&gt; &quot;001&quot;, &quot;002&quot;, &quot;003&quot;, &quot;004&quot;, &quot;005&quot;, &quot;006&quot;, &quot;007&quot;, &quot;008&quot;, &quot;009… ## $ file_das &lt;chr&gt; &quot;HICEASwinter2020.das&quot;, &quot;HICEASwinter2020.das&quot;, &quot;HICEASwinte… ## $ line_num &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 1… Process strata Run the following function to add strata and study-area information to each row of DAS data: dass &lt;- process_strata(das, settings) ## Testing whether each DAS line is in each stratum ... ## --- Stratum 1 of 3 :: HI_EEZ ... ## Spherical geometry (s2) switched off ## --- Stratum 2 of 3 :: WHICEAS ... ## --- Stratum 3 of 3 :: OtherCNP ... ## --- ## Testing whether each DAS line is in the study area ... This function loops through each stratum data.frame you have provided it in settings$strata, formats the stratum, and asks whether each DAS row occurs within it. For each stratum, a column named stratum_&lt;StratumName&gt; is added to the das object; each row in this column is TRUE (included) or FALSE. A similar procedure is run if a dataframe is provided in settings$study_area. A column named study_area is added to das containing a boolean (TRUE if the sub-segment or sighting occurs within the study area). Format DAS data into a cruz object The function format_das() takes care of some final formatting and initiates the cruz object data structure. cruz &lt;- format_das(dass, verbose=TRUE) ## --- removed 71 invalid Cruise numbers .... ## --- removed 0 invalid times .... ## --- removed 0 invalid locations .... ## --- calculating distances (may be slow)... ## --- finding ship name for each cruise number... ## --- preparing stratum assignments for each cohort ... ## --- cohort &quot;default&quot; ... ## --- cohort &quot;fkw_insular&quot; ... This function (1) remove rows with invalid Cruise numbers, times, or locations; (ii) calculate the distance, in km, between each row of data; (iii) adds a ship column to the dataset, with initials for the ship corresponding to each cruise; (iv) creates a new list, cohorts, which copies the cruise data for each cohort specified in your settings; and (v) adds a stratum column to the data in each cohort. That column specifies a single stratum assignment for each row of DAS data in the event of overlapping strata, based upon the cohort setting stratum_overlap_handling. The cruz object The function format_das() returns a list, which we have saved in an object named cruz, with several slots: cruz %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;settings&quot; &quot;strata&quot; &quot;study_area&quot; &quot;cohorts&quot; The slots strata and study_area provide the area, in square km, of each polygon being used: cruz$strata ## stratum area ## 1 HI_EEZ 2491447.3 ## 2 WHICEAS 419789.2 ## 3 OtherCNP 34232739.5 cruz$study_area ## [1] 34232739 The slot cohorts is itself a list with one slot for each cohort. The slots are named using the id cohort setting. cruz$cohorts %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;default&quot; &quot;fkw_insular&quot; Each cohort slot has a copy of the DAS data with a new stratum column, with a stratum assignment tailored to its cohort-specific settings. For instance, the default cohort, whose stratum_overlap_handling is set to \"smallest\", assigns the smallest stratum in the event of overlapping or nested strata: cruz$cohorts$default$stratum %&gt;% table(useNA=&#39;ifany&#39;) ## . ## HI_EEZ WHICEAS ## 142 22228 The fkw_insular cohort, whose stratum_overlap_handling is set to \"each\" (i.e., effort is allowed to belong to multiple segments, if they overlap, and all analyses will be conducted for each stratum separately), has stratum assignments that look like this; cruz$cohorts$fkw_insular$stratum %&gt;% table(useNA=&#39;ifany&#39;) ## . ## HI_EEZ&amp;OtherCNP HI_EEZ&amp;WHICEAS&amp;OtherCNP ## 142 22228 When a row of DAS effort occurs in two overlapping strata, the stratum assignment for that row is a concatentation of the names of the strata it falls within, with names separated by “&amp;”. This list, with these five primary slots, will be referred to as a cruz object. Segmentize the data To allocate survey data into discrete ‘effort segments’, which are used in variance estimation in subsequent steps, run the function segmentize(). This process is controlled by both survey-wide and cohort-specific settings, which are now carried in a slot within the cruz object. The process is outlined in detail in the Appendix on Segmentizing. cruz &lt;- segmentize(cruz, verbose=TRUE) ## Segmentizing data for cohort &quot;default&quot; . . . ## --- preparing `density` dataset ... ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 1 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 2 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 3 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 4 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 5 of 5 . . . ## --- --- calculating details for each segment ... ## --- ## Segmentizing data for cohort &quot;fkw_insular&quot; . . . ## --- preparing `density` dataset ... ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 1 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 2 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 3 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 4 of 5 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 5 of 5 . . . ## --- --- calculating details for each segment ... ## --- preparing `distance` dataset ... ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 1 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 2 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 3 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 4 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 5 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 6 of 7 . . . ## --- --- segmentizing effort bloc 7 of 7 . . . ## --- --- calculating details for each segment ... ## --- This function does not change the high-level structure of the cruz object … cruz %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;settings&quot; &quot;strata&quot; &quot;study_area&quot; &quot;cohorts&quot; … or the cohort names in the cohorts slot … cruz$cohorts %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;default&quot; &quot;fkw_insular&quot; But it does change the structure of data within each cohort. Each cohort will now have a slot named density … cruz$cohorts$default %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;density&quot; And, if your settings specify that settings for density estimation differ from detection function estimation, a cohort will have a second slot named distance. This is the case for the second cohort in our example analysis: fkw_insular. cruz$cohorts$fkw_insular %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;density&quot; &quot;distance&quot; Though their data segmentization will differ, the density and distance slots have identical structures: cruz$cohorts$fkw_insular$density %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;segments&quot;

To demonstrate that versatility, checkout the appendix on segmentizing. Process sightings To process sightings for each cohort of species, use the function process_sightings(). This function has three basic steps: for each cohort, the function (1) prepares a sightings table using the function das_sight() from swfscDAS; (2) filters those sightings to species codes specified for the cohort in your settings input; and (3) evaluates each of those sightings, asking if each should be included in the analysis according to your settings. cruz &lt;- process_sightings(cruz) ## Cohort &quot;default&quot;: analysis: &quot;density&quot;: processing sightings ... ## --- filtering to sightings with species of interest ... ## --- SightNo = 20200119_1, SpCode1 (line = 28, i= 1) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6.9 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200119_18, SpCode1 (line = 370, i= 18) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.2 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200119_19, SpCode1 (line = 377, i= 19) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.8 km. ## --- progress: 5% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200119_25, SpCode1 (line = 532, i= 25) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 5.9 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200119_32, SpCode1 (line = 578, i= 32) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6.4 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200119_33, SpCode1 (line = 588, i= 33) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.2 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200120_4, SpCode1 (line = 800, i= 37) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 5.6 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200120_5, SpCode1 (line = 811, i= 38) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 8.5 km. ## --- progress: 10% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200120_6, SpCode1 (line = 816, i= 39) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.6 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200120_7, SpCode1 (line = 828, i= 40) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.1 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200120_8, SpCode1 (line = 834, i= 41) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 8.3 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200120_10, SpCode1 (line = 854, i= 43) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 8 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200121_3, SpCode1 (line = 1379, i= 49) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 5.6 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_1, SpCode1 (line = 1556, i= 54) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6.8 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_2, SpCode1 (line = 1560, i= 55) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 8.5 km. ## --- progress: 15% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200122_12, SpCode1 (line = 1606, i= 65) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6.2 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_20, SpCode1 (line = 1648, i= 73) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6.8 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_21, SpCode1 (line = 1651, i= 74) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6 km. ## --- progress: 20% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200122_26, SpCode1 (line = 1685, i= 79) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.4 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_34, SpCode1 (line = 1791, i= 87) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.5 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200122_40, SpCode1 (line = 2035, i= 93) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 7.9 km. ## --- progress: 25% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200124_15, SpCode1 (line = 2957, i= 109) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 8.1 km. ## --- progress: 30% complete ... ## --- SightNo = 20200125_1, SpCode1 (line = 3160, i= 120) | Excluded: Beyond truncation km (5.5) = 6 km. ## --- SightNo = 20200127_1, SpCode1 (line = 4331, i= 123) | Excluded: Observer not standard.

Columns of note: species (column 68) contains the species code. There is only one species-code per row (i.e, multi-species sightings have been expanded to multiple rows). best, low, and high (columns 69- 71) contain the refined group size estimates, averaged across observers and calibrated according to the cohort’s settings specifications. For multi-species sightings, these numbers represent the number of individuals for the single species represented in the row (i.e., the original group size estimate has been scaled by the percentage attritbuted to this species). The columns following those group size estimates (prob through calibr) detail how group sizes were estimated: prob indicates whether probable species codes were accepted; mixed indicates whether this species’ sighting is part of a mixed-species sighting; n_sp provides the number of species occurring in this sighitng; n_obs gives the number of observers who contributed group size estimates; n_best through n_high gives the number of valid group size estimates given; and calibr indicates whether or not calibration was attempted for this sighting based on the settings (see next section). As explained above, the final column, included, indicates whether this species should be included in the analysis.

School size estimates In the settings we are using in this tutorial, school size estimates are adjusted using the calibration models from Barlow, Gerrodette, and Perryman (1998) (their analysis is refined slightly and further explained in Gerrodette, Perryman and Barlow, 2002). These calibration corrections are observer-specific. Some observers tend to underestimate school size and their estimates are adjusted up; others tend to overestimate and their estimates are adjusted down. Some observers do not have calibration coefficients, and for them a generic adjustment (upwards, by dividing estimates by 0.8625) is used. Each observer’s estimate is calibrated, then all observer estimates are averaged. To do that averaging, our settings specify that we shall use a geometric weighted mean, instead of an arithmetic mean, that weights school size estimates from multiple observers according to the variance of their calibration coefficients. Here are our current best estimates of school size: cruz$cohorts$default$density$sightings$best %&gt;% head(20) ## [1] 1.000000 18.457718 3.342736 1.000000 2.000000 2.000000 2.000000 ## [8] 3.000000 2.000000 2.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 69.279021 ## [15] 1.000000 1.000000 4.637681 7.777628 1.000000 1.000000 Let’s compare those estimates to unadjusted ones, in which calibration (and therefore weighted geometric mean) is turned off: cruz_demo &lt;- process_sightings(cruz, calibrate = FALSE, verbose = FALSE) cruz_demo$cohorts$default$density$sightings$best %&gt;% head(20) ## [1] 1.000000 19.077486 3.454978 1.000000 2.000000 2.000000 2.000000 ## [8] 3.000000 2.000000 2.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 62.970508 ## [15] 1.000000 1.000000 4.000000 6.708204 1.000000 1.000000 Note that, since calibration is only used for schools above a certain size, the difference between calibration and non-calibrated estimates becomes clearer in larger groups. You can also carry out calibration corrections without using a geometric weighted mean (the arithmetic mean will be used instead): cruz_demo &lt;- process_sightings(cruz, calibrate = TRUE, geometric_mean = FALSE, verbose = FALSE) cruz_demo$cohorts$default$density$sightings$best %&gt;% head(20) ## [1] 1.000000 20.945347 3.793252 1.000000 2.000000 2.000000 2.000000 ## [8] 3.000000 2.000000 2.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 86.815274 ## [15] 1.000000 1.000000 4.637681 8.115942 1.000000 1.000000 Note that when geometric_mean = TRUE but calibration is not carried out, the simple geometric mean is calculated instead of the weighted geometric mean, since the weights are the variance estimates from the calibration routine. Also note that school size calibration is only carried out if settings$group_size_calibration is not NULL. However, even when calibration coefficients are provided, calibration is only carried out for raw estimates above a minimum threshold, since observers are unlikely to mis-estimate the school size of a lone whale or pair. For observers who have calibration coefficients in the settings$group_size_coefficients table, that minimum is specified for each observer individually. For observers not in that table, calibration will only be applied to raw school size estimates of 4 or above. Review By the end of this process, you have a single data object, cruz, with all the data you need to move forward into the next stages of mapping and analysis. cruz %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;settings&quot; &quot;strata&quot; &quot;study_area&quot; &quot;cohorts&quot; Each species-specific cohort has its own list under cruz$cohorts: cruz$cohorts %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;default&quot; &quot;fkw_insular&quot; Each of these cohorts can have two lists, density and distance, which contain the data to be used in those density estimation and detection function estimation, respectively: str(cruz$cohorts, max.level=2, list.len = 10, vec.len = 0, give.length = FALSE, give.attr = FALSE) ## List of 2 ## $ default :List of 1 ## ..$ density:List of 3 ## $ fkw_insular:List of 2 ## ..$ density :List of 3 ## ..$ distance:List of 3 Each of these analysis slots is a list with the same elements: cruz$cohorts$default$density %&gt;% names ## [1] &quot;segments&quot; &quot;das&quot; &quot;sightings&quot; segments is a summary table of segments. das is the raw DAS data, modified with seg_id to associate each row with a segment. sightings is a dataframe of sightings processed according to this cohort’s settings. In each dataframes for each cohort-analysis (e.g., default$density), there are three critically important columns to keep in mind: seg_id: this column is used to indicate the segment ID a row of data belongs to. use: this column indicates whether a row of effort should be used in the analysis. Every row of data within a single segment with have the same use value. included: this column occurs in the sightings dataframe only. It indicates whether the sightings should be included in the analysis based on the specified settings. Any sighting with use == FALSE will also have included == FALSE, but it is possible for sightings to have use == TRUE with included == FALSE. For example, if the setting abeam_sightings is set to FALSE, a sighting with a bearing angle beyond the ship’s beam can be excluded from the analysis (included == FALSE) even though the effort segment it occurs within will still be used (use == TRUE).
