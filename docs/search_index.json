Changes New status report format (a bookdown vignette, compatible with a future website and PDF tutorial.) Initiation of package framework (more efficient to design, develop, test, and document code). See Install chapter for details. Implementation of new settings system: survey-wide and cohort-specific settings. See Settings chapter for description / explanation. Update of strata and segmentizing functions to accommodate new settings system. See Processing chapter. The function process_polygon() now calculates the area, in km2, of strata and study area polygons. Next focus Transfer code to the new settings system and package framework: — mapping functions — sightings processing — survey summary Update backlog Back to developing the sightings processing Questions for Amanda Lots of structural changes (new vignette system, initiation of package framework). Lots on my list to do to complete the transfer, so not many questions for now. Am I getting closer with the new settings / segmentizing frameworks?
